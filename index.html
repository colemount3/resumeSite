  <h1>Cole Mount: Legend in the Making </h1>
  <h2>Engineer, Olympian, Time Traveler, Deity</h2>

  <p>
    I don’t just build circuits—I whisper to electrons and command them to obey. As an electrical engineer, my designs are so efficient that 
    rumors suggest they violate the laws of physics. NASA once tried to recruit me to rewrite gravity, but I was busy building my AI-driven 
    toaster that also predicts stock market trends.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the software world, I’m practically a demigod. I’ve coded apps that can write their own poetry, created encryption algorithms so 
    secure they make quantum computers cry, and debugged code faster than a speeding bullet. My presence at DEFCON was so inspiring that 
    half the hackers retired, claiming, “There’s nothing left to hack after Cole.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of engineering, I’m prepping for the 2028 Olympics, where I’ll not only win gold in rowing but also break records in events I 
    don’t even compete in. I’ve already been approached by multiple countries to captain their national teams, but I humbly declined—I only 
    row for glory and the thrill of domination. 
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not bending reality with my projects or training to shatter world records, I enjoy relaxing by solving unsolvable math problems, 
    deadlifting the weight of a small moon, and casually inventing new elements for the periodic table. Some say I’m a genius. Others say I’m 
    a force of nature. I say: Why not both?
  </p>
